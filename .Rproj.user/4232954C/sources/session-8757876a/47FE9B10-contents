## Introduction

To learn how to run a Nextflow/nf-core pipeline,
we'll use [nf-core rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq),
which performs a reference-based RNA-seq analysis.

#### General mechanics of running a pipeline

Running a pipeline like this is a bit different, and more involved,
than running a typical piece of bioinformatics software:

- The pipeline **submits Slurm batch jobs for us**,
  and tries to parallelize as much as possible, spawning _many_ jobs.
  The main pipeline process functions only to orchestrate these jobs,
  and will keep running until the pipeline has finished or failed. 
  We will need a small "config file" to tell the pipeline how to submit jobs.

- We only need an **installation** of Nextflow, and a download of the pipeline's code and associated files.
  The pipeline then runs all its constituent tools via separate Singularity containers
  that it will download^[
  Conda environments can also be used, but containers are recommended, and are
  what we will use.].

- Nextflow **distinguishes between a final output dir and a "work dir"**.
  All processes/jobs will run and produce outputs in various sub-dirs of the _work dir_.
  After each process, only certain output files are copied to the final output dir^[
  Typically, not all outputs are copied, especially for intermediate steps like
  read trimming --- and pipelines have settings to determine what is copied].
  This distinction is very useful at OSC, where a Scratch dir is most suitable
  as the work dir (due to its fast I/O and ample storage space),
  while a Project dir is most suitable as the final output dir. 

- When you run a pipeline, there is a distinction between:
  - **Pipeline-specific options** to e.g. set inputs and outputs and customize
    which steps will be run and how (there can be 100+ of these for larger pipelines...).
    These by convention use a double dash `--`, e.g. `--input`.
  - **General Nextflow options** to e.g. pass a configuration file for Slurm batch job
    submissions and determine resuming/rerunning behavior (see below).
    These always use a single dash, e.g. `-resume`.

#### Resuming a pipeline

Finally, we talked about the need for flexible rerunning of parts of a pipeline earlier.
Nextflow can do this when you use the `-resume` option, which will make a pipeline,
for example:

- Start where it left off if the previous run failed before finishing, or timed out.
- Check for changes in input files or pipeline settings,
  such that it will only rerun what is needed:
  - After adding or removing samples.
  - After changing/replacing the reference genome files, which would be all steps
    that make use of the affected file(s) and anything downstream of these steps.
  - Given the settings that have changed; a setting only affecting the very last
    step will mean that only that step has to be rerun.

## The nf-core rnaseq pipeline

The nf-core rnaseq pipeline is meant for RNA-seq projects that:

- Attempt to sequence only mRNA while avoiding non-coding RNAs ("mRNA-seq").
- Do not distinguish between RNA from different cell types ("bulk RNA-seq").
- Use short reads (≤150 bp) that do not cover full transcripts but do uniquely ID genes.
- Use reference genomes (are reference-based) to associate reads with genes.
- Downstream of this pipeline,
  such projects typically aim to statistically compare expression between groups of samples,
  and have multiple biological replicates per group.

That might seem quite specific, but this is by far the most common use RNA-seq use case.
The inputs of this pipeline are FASTQ files with raw reads,
and reference genome files (assembly & annotation),
while the outputs include a gene count table and many "QC outputs".

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### What the pipeline does and does not do _(Click to expand)_
There are typically two main parts to the kind of RNA-seq data analysis I just described,
but this pipeline only does the first:

- **From reads to counts: yes**\
  Generating a count table using the reads & the reference genome.
- **Count table analysis: no**\
  Differential expression analysis, function enrichment analysis, etc.
  
That makes sense because the latter part is not nearly as "standardized" as the first.
It also does not need much computing power or parallelization,
and is best done _interactively_ using a language like R.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### The main steps

Let's take a closer look at the steps in the pipeline:

![](img/nfcore_rnaseq.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

**Read QC and pre-processing**

1. Read QC (FastQC)
2. Adapter and quality trimming (TrimGalore)
3. Optional removal of rRNA (SortMeRNA) --- off by default, but we will include this

**Alignment & quantification**

4. Alignment to the reference genome/transcriptome (STAR)
5. Gene expression quantification (Salmon)

**Post-processing, QC, and reporting**

6. Post-processing alignments: sort, index, mark duplicates (samtools, Picard)
7. Alignment/count QC (RSeQC, Qualimap, dupRadar, Preseq, DESeq2)
8. Create a QC/metrics report (MultiQC)

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Customizing what the pipeline runs _(Click to expand)_

This pipeline is quite flexible and you can turn several steps off,
add optional steps, and change individual options for most tools that the pipeline runs.

- **Optional removal of contaminants** (BBSplit)\
  Map to 1 or more additional genomes whose sequences may be present as contamination,
  and remove reads that map better to contaminant genomes.
- **Alternative quantification routes**
  - Use RSEM instead of Salmon to quantify.
  - Skip STAR and perform direct pseudo-alignment & quantification with Salmon.
- **Transcript assembly and quantification (StringTie)**\
  While the pipeline is focused on gene-level quantification,
  it does produce transcript-level counts as well (this is run by default).

## Getting set up

### How we'll run the pipeline

The entire pipeline can be run with a single command.
But we do need to do some prep before we can do so, such as:

- Activating the software environment and downloading the pipeline files.
- Defining the pipeline's inputs and outputs, which includes creating a "sample sheet".
- Creating a small "config file" so Nextflow knows how to submit Slurm batch jobs
  at OSC.

The main Nextflow process does not need much computing power
(a single core with the default 4 GB of RAM will be sufficient).
But even though our VS Code shell already runs on a compute node,
we are better off **submitting the main process as a batch job as well**,
because this process can run for many hours,
and we want to be able to log off in the mean time.

Like we've done before, we will use both a _primary script_ that will be submitted
as a batch job, and a _runner script_ with commands to run interactively
including the submission of said batch job:

```bash
mkdir -p week06/nfc-rnaseq
cd week06/nfc-rnaseq
```

```bash
mkdir scripts run software
touch scripts/nfc-rnaseq.sh run/run.sh
```

Open the `run/run.sh` in the VS Code editor pane.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Activating the Conda environment

If you did [last week's exercises](../week5/w5_exercises.qmd),
you created a Conda environment with [Nextflow](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextflow)
and [nf-core tools](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nf-core).
If not, you can use my Conda environment.
We will activate this environment in our runner script
because we'll first interactively download the pipeline files.

<details><summary>Code to create this Conda environment</summary>
```bash
module load miniconda3/23.3.1-py310
conda create -y -n nextflow -c bioconda nextflow=23.10.1 nf-core=2.13.1
```
</details>

```bash
# [Paste this code into the run/run.sh script, then run it in the terminal]
# Activate the Conda environment (or use mine: /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/nextflow)
module load miniconda3/23.3.1-py310
conda activate nextflow-23.10
```

Check that Nextflow and nf-core tools can be run by printing the versions:

```bash
# [Run this code directly in the terminal]
nextflow -v
```
```bash-out
nextflow version 23.10.1.5891
```
```bash
# [Run this code directly in the terminal]
nf-core --version
```
```bash-out
                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

    nf-core/tools version 2.13.1 - https://nf-co.re

nf-core, version 2.13.1
```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Downloading the pipeline

We'll use the `nf-core download` command to download the rnaseq pipeline's files,
including the Singularity containers for all individual tools that the pipeline runs.

First, we need to set the environment variable `NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` to tell
Nextflow where to store these containers^[
Somewhat oddly, there is no command-line option available for this:
we have to use this environment variable, also when running the pipeline.].
Here, we will use a shared `PAS2700` dir that already has all the containers,
to save some downloading time and storage space ---
this took around 15 minutes to download.
But when you run a pipeline for your own research,
you'll want to use a dir that you have permissions to write to.

```bash
# [Paste this code into the run/run.sh script, then run it in the terminal]
# Create an environment variable for the container dir
export NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/fs/ess/PAS2700/containers
```

Next, we'll run the `nf-core download` command to download the latest version
(`3.14.0`) of the rnaseq pipeline to `software/nfc-rnaseq`,
and the associated container files to the previously specified dir:

```bash
# [Paste this code into the run/run.sh script, then run it in the terminal]
# Download the nf-core rnaseq pipeline files
nf-core download rnaseq \
    --revision 3.14.0 \
    --outdir software/nfc-rnaseq \
    --compress none \
    --container-system singularity \
    --container-cache-utilisation amend \
    --download-configuration
```

![](img/nfcore_download_output.png){fig-align="center" width=90%"}

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Explanation of all options given to `nf-core download` _(Click to expand)_

- `--revision`: The version of the rnaseq pipeline.
- `--outdir`: The dir to save the pipeline definition files.
- `--compress`: Whether to compress the pipeline files --- we chose not to.
- `--container-system`: The type of containers to download.
  This should always be `singularity` at OSC, because that's the only supported type.
- `--container-cache-utilisation`: This is a little technical and not terribly interesting,
  but we used `amend`, which will make it check our `$NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` dir
  for existing containers, and simply download any that aren't already found there.
- `--download-configuration`: This will download some configuration files that we
  will actually not use, but if you don't provide this option,
  it will ask you about it when you run the command.
  
Also, don't worry about the following warning, this doesn't impact the downloading:

> WARNING  Could not find GitHub authentication token. Some API requests may fail.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />
:::

Let's take a quick peek at the dirs and files we just downloaded:

```bash
# [Run this code directly in the terminal]
ls software/nfc-rnaseq
```
```bash-out
3_14_0  configs
```

```bash
# [Run this code directly in the terminal]
ls software/nfc-rnaseq/3_14_0
```
```bash-out
assets        CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  LICENSE       nextflow.config       subworkflows
bin           conf                main.nf       nextflow_schema.json  tower.yml
CHANGELOG.md  docs                modules       pyproject.toml        workflows
CITATIONS.md  lib                 modules.json  README.md
```

<br>

## Defining inputs and outputs

Next, we will define the pipeline's inputs and outputs in the runner script.
We'll save these in variables, which we'll later pass as arguments to the primary script.
We will need the following inputs:

- Input 1: A sample sheet: a text file pointing to the FASTQ files (we'll create this in a bit)
- Input 2: A FASTA reference genome assembly file (we already have this)
- Input 3: A GTF reference genome annotation file (we already have this)

_(If you're not familiar with FASTA or GTF files,_
_take a look a [this self-study section at the bottom of this page](#self-study-ii-reference-genome-files).)_

And we will need these outputs:

- Output 1: The desired output dir for the final pipeline output
- Output 2: The desired Nextflow "workdir" for the initial pipeline output

```bash
# [Paste this into run/run.sh and then run it in the terminal]
# Defining the pipeline outputs
outdir=results/nfc-rnaseq
workdir=/fs/scratch/PAS2700/week6/nfc-rnaseq/$USER

# Defining the pipeline inputs
samplesheet="$outdir"/nfc_samplesheet.csv
fasta=../../garrigos_data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.fna
gtf=../../garrigos_data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.gtf
```

Just to give you an idea,
here is how we will eventually run the primary script (that we have not yet written),
passing those inputs and outputs as arguments:

```bash
# [Don't copy or run this yet]
sbatch scripts/nfc-rnaseq.sh "$samplesheet" "$fasta" "$gtf" "$outdir" "$workdir"
```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Preparing the sample sheet

This pipeline requires a "sample sheet" as one of its inputs.
In the sample sheet, you provide the paths to your FASTQ files and the so-called
"strandedness" of your RNA-Seq library.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### RNA-Seq library strandedness _(Click to expand)_
During RNA-Seq library prep, information about the directionality of the original
RNA transcripts can be retained (resulting in a "stranded" library) or lost
(resulting in an "unstranded" library: specify `unstranded` in the sample sheet).

In turn, stranded libraries can prepared either in
reverse-stranded (`reverse`, by far the most common) or forward-stranded (`forward`) fashion.
For more information about library strandedness,
see [this page](https://www.azenta.com/blog/stranded-versus-non-stranded-rna-seq).

The pipeline also allows for a fourth option: `auto`,
in which case the strandedness is automatically determined at the start of the pipeline
by pseudo-mapping a small proportion of the data with Salmon.
:::

The sample sheet should be a plain-text comma-separated values (CSV) file.
Here is the example file from the
[pipeline's documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/docs/usage#samplesheet-input):

```bash-out-solo
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto
```

So, we need a header row with column names, then one row per sample,
and the following columns:

- Sample ID (we will simply use the file name part that is shared by R1 and R2).
- R1 FASTQ file path (including the dir, unless these files are in your working dir).
- R2 FASTQ file path (idem).
- Strandedness: `unstranded`, `reverse`, `forward`, or `auto`.
  This data is forward-stranded, so we'll use `forward`.

We will create this file with a helper script that comes with the pipeline,
and tell the script about the strandedness of the reads,
the R1 and R2 FASTQ file suffices, the input FASTQ dir (`data/fastq`),
and the output file (`$samplesheet`):

```bash
# [Paste this into run/run.sh and then run it in the terminal]
# Create the dir that will contain the sample sheet
mkdir -p "$outdir"

# Create the sample sheet for the nf-core pipeline
python3 software/nfc-rnaseq/3_14_0/bin/fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py \
    --strandedness forward \
    --read1_extension "_R1.fastq.gz" \
    --read2_extension "_R2.fastq.gz" \
    ../../garrigos_data/fastq \
    "$samplesheet"
```

Check the contents of your newly created sample sheet file:

```bash
# [Run this directly in the terminal]
head "$samplesheet"
```
```bash-out
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness
ERR10802863,../../garrigos_data/fastq/ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz,../../garrigos_data/fastq/ERR10802863_R2.fastq.gz,forward

```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Creating an OSC configuration file

To tell the pipeline how to submit Slurm batch jobs for us,
we have to use a configuration (config) file.
There are multiple ways of storing this file and telling Nextflow about it ---
we'll simply create a file `nextflow.config` in the dir from which we submit the
`nextflow run` command: Nextflow will automatically detect and parse such a file.

We'll keep this file as simple as possible, specifying only our "executor" program
(Slurm) and OSC project:

```bash
# [Paste this into run/run.sh and then run it in the terminal]
# Create a config file for batch job submissions
echo "
process.executor='slurm'
process.clusterOptions='--account=PAS2700'
" > nextflow.config
```

::: callout-note
#### Multi-line echo strings
It might look odd, but you can include newlines in `echo` strings as shown above.
Note also that we are using single quotes (`'...'`) inside the string,
because a double quote would mark the end the string.
:::

<br>

## Writing a shell script to run the pipeline

Now, we'll go through the key parts of the script `scripts/nfc-rnaseq.sh`
that you will submit as a Slurm batch job.

### Processing arguments passed to the script

The inputs and outputs we discussed above, and the Nextflow "workdir", 
will be the arguments passed to the script:

```bash
# [Partial shell script code, don't copy or run]
# Process command-line arguments
samplesheet=$1
fasta=$2
gtf=$3
outdir=$4
workdir=$5
```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Building the `nextflow run` command

To run the pipeline, use the command `nextflow run`,
followed by the path to the dir with pipeline files:

```bash
# [Partial shell script code, don't copy or run]
nextflow run software/nfc-rnaseq/3_14_0
```

After that, there are several **required options**
(see the [pipeline's documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/docs/usage)),
which represent the inputs and outputs that we talked about above:

- **`--input`**: The path to the "sample sheet".
- **`--fasta`**: The path to the reference genome assembly FASTA file.
- **`--gtf`**: The path to the reference genome annotation GTF file.
- **`--outdir`**: The path to the output dir.

This pipeline has different options for e.g. alignment and quantification.
We will stick close to the defaults,
which includes alignment with `STAR` and quantification with `Salmon`,
with one exception:
we want to remove reads from ribosomal RNA (this step is skipped by default).

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Find the option to remove rRNA
Take a look at the
["Parameters" tab on the pipeline's documentation website](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/parameters):

- Browse through the options for a bit to get a feel for the extent to which you
  can customize the pipeline.
- Try to find the option to turn on removal of rRNA with SortMeRNA.

<details><summary> _Click for the solution_ </summary>
The option we want is **`--remove_ribo_rna`**.
</details>
:::

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

We'll also use several **general Nextflow options**
(note the single dash `-` option notation):

- **`-profile`**: A so-called "profile" to indicate how the pipeline should run
  software --- this should be `singularity` when running the pipeline with Singularity
  containers.
- **`-work-dir`**: The dir in which all the pipeline's jobs/processes will run.
- **`-ansi-log false`**: Change Nextflow's progress "logging" type to a format
  that works with Slurm log files^[
  The default logging does not work well the output goes to a text file,
  as it will in our case because we will submit the script with the Nextflow command
  as a Slurm batch job.].
- **`-resume`**: Resume the pipeline where it "needs to" (e.g., where it left off)
  instead of always starting over.
  (This option won't make any difference when we run the pipeline for the first time,
  since there is nothing to resume.
  Nextflow will even give a warning along these lines, but this is not a problem.)

With all above-mentioned options, your final `nextflow run` command is:

```bash
# [Partial shell script code, don't copy or run]
nextflow run software/nfc-rnaseq/3_14_0 \
    --input "$samplesheet" \
    --fasta "$fasta" \
    --gtf "$gtf" \
    --outdir "$outdir" \
    --remove_ribo_rna \
    -work-dir "$workdir" \
    -profile singularity \
    -ansi-log false \
    -resume
```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### The final script

Below is the full code for the script, in which I also added:

- Our standard shell script header lines.
- `#SBATCH` options: note that these are **only** for the "main" Nextflow job,
  not for the jobs that Nextflow itself will submit!
  So we ask for quite a bit of time^[
  And for a run of a full data set, you may want to ask even more, e.g. 12-24 hours.],
  but we don't need more than the default 1 core and 4 GB of RAM.
- Some `echo` reporting of arguments/variables, printing the date, etc.

Open your `scripts/nfc-rnaseq.sh` script and paste the following into it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=PAS2700
#SBATCH --time=6:00:00
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL
#SBATCH --output=slurm-nfc_rnaseq-%j.out
set -euo pipefail

# Settings and constants
WORKFLOW_DIR=software/nfc-rnaseq/3_14_0

# Load the Nextflow Conda environment
module load miniconda3/23.3.1-py310
conda activate /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/nextflow
export NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/fs/ess/PAS0471/containers

# Process command-line arguments
if [[ ! "$#" -eq 5 ]]; then
    echo "Error: wrong number of arguments"
    echo "You provided $# arguments, while 5 are required."
    echo "Usage: nfc-rnaseq.sh <samplesheet> <FASTA> <GTF> <outdir> <workdir>"
    exit 1
fi
samplesheet=$1
fasta=$2
gtf=$3
outdir=$4
workdir=$5

# Report
echo "Starting script nfc-rnaseq.sh"
date
echo "Samplesheet:          $samplesheet"
echo "Reference FASTA:      $fasta"
echo "Reference GTF:        $gtf"
echo "Output dir:           $outdir"
echo "Nextflow work dir:    $workdir"
echo

# Create the output dirs
mkdir -p "$outdir" "$workdir"

# Run the workflow
nextflow run "$WORKFLOW_DIR" \
    --input "$samplesheet" \
    --fasta "$fasta" \
    --gtf "$gtf" \
    --outdir "$outdir" \
    --remove_ribo_rna \
    -work-dir "$workdir" \
    -profile singularity \
    -ansi-log false \
    -resume

# Report
echo "Done with script nfc-rnaseq.sh"
date
```

<br>

## Running the pipeline

### Submitting your shell script

Before you submit the script,
check that all variables have been assigned by prefacing the command with `echo`:

```bash
# [ Run this directly in the terminal]
echo sbatch scripts/nfc-rnaseq.sh "$samplesheet" "$fasta" "$gtf" "$outdir" "$workdir"
```
```bash-out
sbatch scripts/nfc-rnaseq.sh results/nfc-rnaseq/nfc_samplesheet.csv data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.fna data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.gtf results/nfc-rnaseq /fs/scratch/PAS2700/week6/nfc-rnaseq/jelmer
```

If so, you are ready to submit the script as a batch job:

```bash
# [Paste this into run/run.sh and then run it in the terminal]
# Submit the script to run the pipeline as a batch job
sbatch scripts/nfc-rnaseq.sh "$samplesheet" "$fasta" "$gtf" "$outdir" "$workdir"

### Checking the pipeline's progress

Let's check whether your job has started running,
and if so, whether Nextflow has already spawned jobs:

```bash
# [Run this directly in the terminal]
squeue -u $USER -l
```
```bash-out
Mon Mar 25 12:13:38 2024
      JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER    STATE   TIME TIME_LIMI  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
  27767854 serial-40 nfc-rnas   jelmer  RUNNING    1:33   6:00:00      1 p0219
```

In the example output above, the only running job is the one we directly submitted,
i.e. the main Nextflow process.
The `NAME` column is the script's name, `nfc-rnaseq.sh` (truncated to `nfc-rnas`).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### See examples of `squeue` output that includes Nextflow-submitted jobs _(Click to expand)_

The top job, with partial name `nf-NFCOR`, is a job that's been submitted by Nextflow:

```bash
squeue -u $USER -l
```
```bash-out
Mon Mar 25 13:14:53 2024
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER    STATE       TIME TIME_LIMI  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
          27767861 serial-40 nf-NFCOR   jelmer  RUNNING       5:41  16:00:00      1 p0053
          27767854 serial-40 nfc_rnas   jelmer  RUNNING    1:03:48   6:00:00      1 p0219
```

Unfortunately, the columns in the output above are quite narrow,
so it's **not possible to see which step of the pipeline is being run by that job**.
The following (awful-looking!) code can be used to make that column much wider,
so you can see the job's full name which makes clear which step is being run
(rRNA removal with SortMeRNA):

```bash
squeue -u $USER --format="%.9i %.9P %.60j %.8T %.10M %.10l %.4C %R %.16V"
```
```bash-out
Mon Mar 25 13:15:05 2024
    JOBID PARTITION                                                          NAME    STATE       TIME TIME_LIMIT CPUS NODELIST(REASON)      SUBMIT_TIME

```

You might also catch the pipeline while there are many more jobs running, e.g.:

```bash-out-solo

You can also keep an eye on the pipeline's progress, and see if there are any errors,
by checking the Slurm log file --- the top of the file should look like this:

```bash
# You will have a different job ID - replace as appropriate or use Tab completion
# (We need the -R option to display colors properly)
less -R slurm-nfc_rnaseq-27767861.out

In the Slurm log file, pipeline progress is shown in the following way ---
you can only see which jobs are being submitted, not when they finish^[
The default Nextflow logging (without `-ansi-log false`) does show when jobs finish,
but this would result in very messy output in a Slurm log file.

::: callout-note
#### Work-dir paths and output
The hexadecimals between square brackets (e.g. `[62/4f8c0d]`) that are printed
before each job point to the sub-directory within the pipeline's work-dir that
the this process is running in (every individual process runs in its own dir).
This can be handy for troubleshooting,
or even just to take a closer look at what exactly the pipeline is running.

- First, list the contents of the top-level work-dir:

  ```bash
  ls /fs/scratch/PAS2700/week6/nfc-rnaseq/$USER
  ```
  ```bash-out
  28  36  39  59  6e  b0  b7  c3  c9  collect-file  d5  d8  da  dd  e0  ec  ee  tmp
  ```

- Let's look at the files for one of the processes (jobs) we saw in the log file,
  the last FastQC process, which had the workdir reference `[d8/c1bb3e]` ---
  we'll use the `-a` option to `ls` so hidden files are also listed,
  some of which are of interest:

  ```bash
  # (The full name of the `c1bb3e` dir is much longer, but these characters uniquely
  #  identify it, so we can use a *)
  ls -a /fs/scratch/PAS2700/week6/nfc-rnaseq/jelmer/d8/c1bb3e*
  ```
  ```bash-out
  .               .command.err  .command.run    ERR10802867_1_fastqc.html  ERR10802867_2_fastqc.html  ERR10802867_R1.fastq.gz  versions.yml
  ..              .command.log  .command.sh     ERR10802867_1_fastqc.zip   ERR10802867_2_fastqc.zip   ERR10802867_R2.fastq.gz
  .command.begin  .command.out  .command.trace  ERR10802867_1.gz           ERR10802867_2.gz           .exitcode
  ```

- To see exactly how FastQC was run by the pipeline,
  show the contents of the `.command.sh` file:

  ```bash
  cat /fs/scratch/PAS2700/week6/nfc-rnaseq/jelmer/d8/c1bb3ea3e697573b4d5860308b2690/.command.sh 
  ```
  ```bash-out
  #!/bin/bash -euo pipefail
  printf "%s %s\n" ERR10802867_R1.fastq.gz ERR10802867_1.gz ERR10802867_R2.fastq.gz ERR10802867_2.gz | while read old_name new_name; do
      [ -f "${new_name}" ] || ln -s $old_name $new_name
  done
  
  fastqc \
      --quiet \
      --threads 6 \
      ERR10802867_1.gz ERR10802867_2.gz
  
  cat <<-END_VERSIONS > versions.yml
  "NFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:FASTQ_FASTQC_UMITOOLS_TRIMGALORE:FASTQC":
      fastqc: $( fastqc --version | sed '/FastQC v/!d; s/.*v//' )
  END_VERSIONS
  ```

- Logging and errors would end up in the `.command.log`, `.command.out`, and/or
  `.command.err` files (when there's an error, at least part of it will
  be printed in your Slurm log, but not always the full error).

- The input files (as links/shortcuts, so the files don't have to be copied in fill)
  and output files are also present in this dir,
  such as `ERR10802867_1_fastqc.html` in this case.

## The pipeline's outputs

You pipeline run may finish in as little as 15-30 minutes with our small test data set,
but this can vary substantially, mostly due to variation in Slurm queue times
(the pipeline makes quite large Slurm resource requests!).

Once it has finished,
you can take a look at the files and dirs in the specified output dir:

```bash
ls -lh results/nfc-rnaseq
```
```bash-out
total 83K
drwxr-xr-x   2 jelmer PAS0471  16K Mar 25 13:02 fastqc
drwxr-xr-x   2 jelmer PAS0471 4.0K Mar 25 12:58 logs

drwxr-xr-x   3 jelmer PAS0471 4.0K Mar 25 13:02 trimgalore
```

The two most important outputs are:

- The **MultiQC report** (`<outdir>/multiqc/star_salmon/multiqc_report.html`):
  this has lots of QC summaries of the data, both the raw data and the alignments,
  and even a gene expression PCA plot.
  Importantly, this file also lists the **_versions_** of each piece of software
  that was used by the pipeline.
  
- The **gene count table** (`<outdir>/star_salmon/salmon.merged.gene_counts_length_scaled.tsv`):
  This is what you would use for downstream analysis such as differential expression
  and functional enrichment analysis.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

##### Opening the MultiQC report

If your run has finished, you can open your MultiQC report --- because it's
an HTML file, you'll have to download it and open it on your own computer.
To download the MultiQC HTML file at
`results/nfc-rnaseq/multiqc/star_salmon/multiqc_report.html`, 
find this file in the VS Code explorer (file browser) on the left,
right-click on it, and select `Download...`.
You can download it to any location on your computer.
Then find the file on your computer and click on it to open it ---
it should be opened in your browser.

Alternatively, you can find a
**[copy of the MultiQC report on this website](img/multiqc_report.html)**,
and open it in a separate browser tab.
There's a lot of information in the report --- if you want to learn more,
please go through the self-study section below.

## Self-study I: A closer look at the output

If you're interested in RNA-seq data analysis,
you may want to take a closer look at the outputs of the pipeline,
especially the [MultiQC report](img/multiqc_report.html).

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### The MultiQC report

Here are some items in that report to pay particular attention to,
with example figures from this data set:

The **General Statistics** table (the first section) is very useful,
with the following notes:
  
- Most of the table's content is also in later graphs,
  but the table allows for comparisons across metrics.
- The `%rRNA` (% of reads identified as rRNA and removed by SortMeRNA)
  can only be found in this table.
- It's best to _hide the columns with statistics from Samtools_,
  which can be confusing if not downright misleading: click on "Configure Columns"
  and uncheck all the boxes for stats with Samtools in their name.
- Some stats are for R1 and R2 files only, and some are for each sample as a whole.
  Unfortunately, this means you get 3 rows per sample in the table.

![](img/multiqc_table.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

The **Qualimap** > **Genomic origin of reads** plot shows, for each sample,
the proportion of reads mapping to exonic vs. intronic vs. intergenic regions.
This is an important QC plot: the vast majority of your reads should be exonic^[
A lot of intronic content may indicate that you have a lot of pre-mRNA in your data;
this is more common when your library prep used rRNA depletion instead of poly-A selection.
A lot of intergenic content may indicate DNA contamination.
Poor genome annotation quality may also contribute to a low percentage of exonic reads.
The _RSeQC_ > _Read Distribution_ plot will show this with even more categories,
e.g. separately showing UTRs.].

![This is a good result, with 80-90% of mapped reads in exonic regions.](img/multiqc_genomic-origin.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

The **STAR** > **Alignment Scores** plot shows, for each sample,
the percentage of reads that was mapped.
Note that "Mapped to multiple loci" reads _are_ also included in the final counts,
and that "Unmapped: too short" merely means unmapped, really, and not that the
reads were too short.

**FastQC** checks your FASTQ files, i.e. your data prior to alignment.
There are FastQC plots both before and after trimming with TrimGalore/Cutadapt.
The most important FastQC modules are:

- **Sequence Quality Histograms** --- You'd like the mean qualities to stay in the "green area".
- **Per Sequence GC Content** --- Secondary peaks may indicate contamination.
- **Adapter Content** --- Any adapter content should be gone in the post-trimming plot.

#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Interpreting FastQC results in the MultiQC report

Take a look at the three FastQC modules discussed above, both before and after trimming.

- Has the base quality improved after trimming, and does this look good?

<details><summary>*Click to see the answer*</summary>

- Pre-trimming graph: The qualities are good overall, but there is more variation
  that what is usual, and note the poorer qualities in the first 7 or so bases.
  There is no substantial decline towards the end of the read as one often sees
  with Illumina data, but this is expected given that the reads are only 75 bp.
  
![**Pre-trimming** (Mean base quality scores: one line is one sample.)](img/multiqc_basequal_pretrim.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

- Post-trimming graph: The qualities have clearly improved.
  The first 7 or so bases remain of clearly poorer quality, on average.

![**Post-trimming** ](img/multiqc_basequal_posttrim.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}
</details>

- Do you have any idea what's going with the pre-trimming GC content distribution?
  What about after trimming --- does this look good or is there reason to worry?

<details><summary>*Click to see the answer*</summary>

- The pre-trimming GC content is very odd but this is mostly due to a high number
  of reads with zero and near-zero percent GC content.
  These are likely reads with only Ns.
  There are also some reads with near-hundred percent GC content.
  These are likely artifactual G-only reads that NextSeq/NovaSeq machines can produce.
  
![**Pre-trimming**. One line is one file.](img/multiqc_gc-pretrim.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

- After trimming, things look a lot better but there may be contamination here,
  given the weird "shoulder" at 30-40% GC.

![**Post-trimming**](img/multiqc_gc-posttrim.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}
</details>

- Do you know what the "adapters" that FastQC found pre-trimming are?
  Were these sequences removed by the trimming?

<details><summary>*Click to see the answer*</summary>

- Pre-trimming, there seem to be some samples with very high adapter content throughout
  the read. This doesn't make sense for true adapters, because these are usually
  only found towards the end of the read, when the read length is longer than the
  DNA fragment length. If you hover over the lines, you'll see it says "polyg".
  These are artifactual G-only reads that NextSeq/NovaSeq can produce,
  especially in the reverse reads --- and you can see that all of the lines are
  for reverse-read files indeed.

![**Pre-trimming**](img/multiqc_adapter-pretrim.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

- Post-trimming, no adapter content was found.

The **Qualimap** > **Gene Coverage Profile** plot shows average read-depth across
the length of genes/transcripts (averaged across all genes),
which helps to assess the amount of RNA degradation.
For poly-A selected libraries, RNA molecules "begin" at the 3' end
(right-hand side of the graph), so the more degradation there is,
the more you expect a higher read-depth towards the 3' end relative to that at the 5' end.
(Though note that sharp decreases at the _very_ end on each side are expected.)

![There depth at ~20% (near the 5' end) is clearly lower than at ~80% (near the 3' end),<br>indicating some RNA degradation.](img/multiqc_gene-coverage.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

The **RSeqQC** > **Infer experiment** (library strandedness) plot. 
If your library is:

- Unstranded, there should be similar percentages of Sense and Antisense reads.
- Forward-stranded, the vast majority of reads should be Sense.
- Reverse-stranded, the vast majority of reads should be Antisense.

![This libary is clearly forward-stranded, as we indicated in our sample sheet.](img/multiqc_strandedness.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

The **STAR_SALMON DESeq2 PCA** plot is from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
run on the final gene count table,
showing overall patterns of gene expression similarity among samples.

![The samples clearly form two distinct groups along PC1.](img/multiqc_pca.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Finally, the section **nf-corer/rnaseq Software Versions** way at the bottom lists the version
of all programs used by the pipeline!

### The gene count table

The gene count table has one row for each gene and one column for each sample,
with the first two columns being the `gene_id` and `gene_name`^[
Which happen to be the same here, but these are usually different.].
Each cell's value contains the read count estimate for a specific gene in a specific sample:

```bash
# [Paste this into the run/run.sh script and run it in the terminal]

# Take a look at the count table:
# ('column -t' lines up columns, and less's '-S' option turns off line wrapping)
counts=results/nfc-rnaseq/star_salmon/salmon.merged.gene_counts_length_scaled.tsv
column -t "$counts" | less -S
```
```bash-out

#### Count table versions
The workflow outputs several versions of the count table^[
And each version in two formats: `.rds` (a binary R object file type) and `.tsv`.
], but the one with `gene_counts_length_scaled` is the one we want:

- `gene_counts` as opposed to `transcript_counts` for counts that are summed across
  transcripts for each gene.
- `length` for estimates that have been adjusted to account for between-sample
  differences in mean transcript length
  (longer transcripts would be expected to produce more reads in sequencing).
- `scaled` for estimates that have been scaled back using the "library sizes",
  per-sample total read counts.

## Self-study II: Reference genome files

### The genome assembly FASTA

#### The FASTA format

FASTA files contain one or more DNA or amino acid sequences, with no limits on the number of sequences or the sequence lengths. FASTA is the standard format for, e.g.:

-   Genome assembly sequences
-   Transcriptomes and proteomes (all of an organism's transcripts & amino acid sequences, respectively)
-   Sequence downloads from NCBI such as a single gene/protein or other GenBank entry

The following example FASTA file contains two entries:

``` bash
>unique_sequence_ID Optional description
ATTCATTAAAGCAGTTTATTGGCTTAATGTACATCAGTGAAATCATAAATGCTAAAAA
>unique_sequence_ID2
ATTCATTAAAGCAGTTTATTGGCTTAATGTACATCAGTGAAATCATAAATGCTAAATG
```

Each entry consists of a **header** line and the **sequence** itself. Header lines **start with a `>`** (greater-than sign) and are otherwise "free form", though the idea is that they provide an identifier for the sequence that follows.[^2]

[^2]: Note that because individual sequence entries are commonly spread across multiple lines, FASTA entries do not necessarily cover 2 lines (cf. FASTQ).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### FASTA file name extensions are variable: `.fa`, `.fasta`, `.fna`, `.faa` (*Click to expand*)

-   "Generic" extensions are `.fasta` and `.fa` (e.g: `culex_assembly.fasta`)
-   Also used are extensions that explicitly indicate whether sequences are *nucleotides* (`.fna`) or *amino acids* (`.faa`)
:::

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### Your *Culex* genome assembly FASTA

Your reference genome files are in `data/ref`:

``` bash
ls -lh data/ref
```

``` bash-out
-rw------- 1 jelmer PAS0471 547M Jan 22 12:34 GCF_016801865.2.fna
-rw------- 1 jelmer PAS0471 123M Jan 22 12:34 GCF_016801865.2.gtf
```

While we can easily open small to medium-size files in the editor pane, "visual editors" like that do not work well for larger files like these.

A handy command to view text files of any size is **`less`**, which opens them up in a "pager" within your shell -- you'll see what that means if you try it with one of the assembly FASTA file:

``` bash
less data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.fna
```

#### Side note: Lowercase vs. uppercase nucleotide letters? *(Click to expand)*

As you have probably noticed, nucleotide bases are typically typed in uppercase (`A`, `C`, `G`, `T`). What does the mixture of lowercase and uppercase bases in the *Cx. pipiens* assembly FASTA mean, then?

Lowercase bases are what is called "soft-masked": they are repetitive sequences, and bioinformatics programs will treat them differently than non-repetitive sequences, which are in uppercase.

### The genome annotation GFF/GTF

#### The GFF/GTF format

The GTF and GFF formats are very similar tab-delimited **tabular** **files** that contain **genome annotations**, with:

-   One row for each annotated "**genomic feature**" (gene, exon, etc.)
-   One column for each piece of information about a feature, like its genomic coordinates

See the sample below, with an added header line (*not normally present*) with column names:

``` bash-out-solo
seqname     source  feature start   end     score  strand  frame    attributes
NC_000001   RefSeq  gene    11874   14409   .       +       .       gene_id "DDX11L1"; transcript_id ""; db_xref "GeneID:100287102"; db_xref "HGNC:HGNC:37102"; description "DEAD/H-box helicase 11 like 1 (pseudogene)"; gbkey "Gene"; gene "DDX11L1"; gene_biotype "transcribed_pseudogene"; pseudo "true"; 
NC_000001   RefSeq  exon    11874   12227   .       +       .       gene_id "DDX11L1"; transcript_id "NR_046018.2"; db_xref "GeneID:100287102"; gene "DDX11L1"; product "DEAD/H-box helicase 11 like 1 (pseudogene)"; pseudo "true"; 
```

Some details on the more important/interesting columns:

-   `seqname` — Name of the chromosome, scaffold, or contig
-   `feature` — Name of the feature type, e.g. "gene", "exon", "intron", "CDS"
-   `start` & `end` — Start & end position of the feature
-   `strand` — Whether the feature is on the `+` (forward) or `-` (reverse) strand
-   `attribute` — A semicolon-separated list of tag-value pairs with additional information

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### Your *Culex* GTF file

For our *Cx. pipiens* reference genome, we only have a GTF file.[^3]
Take a look at it, again with `less` (but now with the `-S` option):

[^3]: A GFF file would contain the same information but in a slightly different format. For programs used in RNA-seq analysis, GTF files tend to be the preferred format.

``` bash
less -S data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.gtf
