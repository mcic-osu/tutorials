### What?

Create a personal GitHub account.

### Why?

GitHub is a website that hosts *Git repositories*, i.e. version-controlled projects.
In Week 3 of this course, you will be learning how to use Git together with GitHub.
In addition, you will submit your final project assignments through GitHub.

### How?

*If you already have a GitHub account, [log in](https://github.com/) and start at step 6.*

1. Go to <https://github.com>.

2. Click "Sign Up" in the top right.

3. Follow the prompts to create your account --- some notes:
  
   - When choosing your **_username_**, I would recommend to
     *keep it professional and have it include or resemble your real name*.
     (This is because you will hopefully continue to use GitHub to share your code,
     for instance when publishing a paper.)
  
   - You can choose whether you want to use your OSU email address
     or a non-institutional **_email address_**.
     (And note that you can always associate a second email address with your account.)

5. Check your email and click the link to **_verify your email address_**.
   
6. Back on GitHub website, now logged in: in the far top-right of the page,
   click your randomly assigned avatar, and in the dropdown menu, click "Settings".

7. In the "Emails" tab (left-hand menu), deselect the box "Keep my email addresses private". 

8. In the "Public profile" tab, enter your name.

9. Still in the "Profile tab", upload a Profile picture.
   This can be a picture of yourself but if you prefer, you can use something else.
