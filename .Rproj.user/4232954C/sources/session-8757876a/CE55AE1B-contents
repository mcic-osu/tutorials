## Project organization: best practices & recommendations

Good project organization and documentation facilitates:

- Collaborating with others (and yourself in the future...)
- Reproducibility
- Automation
- Version control
- Preventing your files slowly devolving into a state of incomprehensible chaos

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Some underlying principles

#### Use one dir (dir hierarchy) for one project

Using one directory hierarchy for one project means:

- Don't mix files/subdirs for multiple distinct projects inside one dir.
- Don't keep files for one project in multiple places.

When you have a single directory hierarchy for each project, it is:

- Easier to find files, share your project, not throw away stuff in error, etc.
- Possible to use *relative paths* within a project's scripts,
  which makes it more portable (more on that in a bit).

#### Separate different kinds of files using a consistent dir structure

Within your project's directory hierarchy:

- Separate code from data.
- Separate raw data from processed data & results.

Also:

- Treat raw data as read-only.
- Treat generated output as somewhat disposable and as possible to regenerate.

And, as we'll talk about below:

- Use consistent dir and file naming that follow certain best practices.
- Slow down and document what you're doing.

### Absolute versus relative paths

Recall that:

- **Absolute paths** start from the computer's root dir and do not depend on your working dir.
- **Relative paths** start from a specific *working dir* (and won't work if you're elsewhere).

<details><summary>Don't absolute paths sound better? What could be a disadvantage of them?</summary>

Absolute paths:
- Don't generally work across computers
- Break when your move a project

Whereas relative paths, as long as you consistently use the root of the project as the working dir,
keep working when moving the project within and between computers.

### But how to define and separate projects?

From [Wilson et al. 2017 - Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510):

> *As a rule of thumb, divide work into projects based on the overlap in data and code files:*
>
> - *If 2 research efforts share no data or code,*
>   *they will probably be easiest to manage independently.*  
>
> - *If they share more than half of their data and code, they are probably best*
>   *managed together.*
>
> - *If you are building tools that are used in several projects,*
>   *the common code should probably be in a project of its own.*

#### Projects with shared data or code

To access files outside of the project (e.g., shared across projects),
it is easiest to create **links** to these files:

![The data is located in `project1` but used in both projects.<br>`project2` contains a link to the data.](img/proj-dirs-4.svg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

But shared data or scripts are generally better stored in separate dirs,
and then linked to by each project using them:

![Now, the data is in it's own top-level dir, with links to it in both projects.](img/proj-dirs-5.svg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

These strategies do decrease the portability of your project,
and moving the shared files even within your own computer will cause links to break.

A more portable method is to **keep shared (multi-project) files online** ---
this is especially feasible for **scripts** under version control:  

![A set of scripts shared by two projects is stored in an online repository like at GitHub.](img/proj-dirs-6.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

::: callout-info
For **data**, this is also possible but often not practical due to file sizes.
It's easier after data has been deposited in a public repository.

### Example project dir structure

Here is one good way of organizing a project with top-levels dirs:

![](img/proj-ex_annot.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

::: callout-tip
#### Other reasonable options
These recommendations only go so far,
and several things do depend on personal preferences and project specifics:

- `data` as single top-level dir, or separate `metadata`, `refdata`, `raw_data` dirs?  
- Naming of some dirs, like:
  - `results` vs `analysis` (Buffalo)
  - `src` (source) vs `scripts`
- Sometimes the order of subdirs can be done in multiple different ways.
  For example, where to put QC figures --- `results/plots/qc` or `results/qc/plots/`?

:::

Another important good practice is to **use subdirectories** liberally and hierarchically.
For example, in omics data analysis, it often makes sense to create
subdirs within `results` for each piece of software that you are using:

## File naming

Three principles for good file names
([from Jenny Bryan](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)):

- Machine-readable
- Human-readable
- Playing well with default ordering

#### Machine-readable

Consistent and informative naming helps you to programmatically find and process files.

- In file names, provide **metadata** like Sample ID, date, and treatment:
  - `sample032_2016-05-03_low.txt`  
  - `samples_soil_treatmentA_2019-01.txt`

- With such file names, you can easily select samples from e.g. a certain month or treatment
  (*more on Thursday*):
  
  ```bash
  ls *2016-05*
  
  ls *treatmentA*
  ```

- Spaces in file names lead to inconvenience at best and disaster at worst (see example below).
  
- More generally, only use the following in file names:
  - Alphanumeric characters <kbd>A-Za-z0-9</kbd>
  - Underscores <kbd>_</kbd>
  - Hyphens (dashes) <kbd>-</kbd>
  - Periods (dots) <kbd>.</kbd>

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Spaces in file names --- what could go wrong?

- Say, you have a dir with some raw data in the dir `raw`:

  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  ```bash-out
  raw
  ```

- Now you create a dir for sequences, with a space in the file name:

  ```bash
  mkdir "raw sequences"
  ```

- You don't want this dir after all, and carelessly try to remove it  
  
  ```bash
  rm -r raw sequences
  ```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

<details><summary>What will go wrong in the example above? _(Click for the answer)_</summary>
The `rm` command will not remove the dir with the space in the file name,
but it will remove the "earlier" `raw` dir.
</details>

#### Human-readable

> *"Name all files to reflect their content or function.*
> *For example, use names such as bird_count_table.csv, manuscript.md,*
> *or sightings_analysis.py.*"  
> --- [Wilson et al. 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### Combining machine- and human-readable

- One good way (opinionated recommendations):
  - Use **underscores** (<kbd>_</kbd>) to delimit units you may later want to
    separate on: sampleID, batch, treatment, date.
  - Within such units, use **dashes** (<kbd>-</kbd>) to delimit words: `grass-samples`.
  - Limit the use of **periods** (<kbd>.</kbd>) to indicate file extensions.
  - Generally *avoid capitals*.

- For example:
  
  ```bash-out
  mmus001_treatmentA_filtered-mq30-only_sorted_dedupped.bam
  mmus002_treatmentA_filtered-mq30-only_sorted_dedupped.bam
  .
  .
  mmus086_treatmentG_filtered-mq30-only_sorted_dedupped.bam
  ```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### Playing well with default ordering

- Use **leading zeros** for lexicographic sorting: `sample005`.
- **Dates** should always be written as `YYYY-MM-DD`: `2020-10-11`.
- **Group similar files together** by starting with same phrase,
  and **number scripts** by execution order:
  
  ```sh
  DE-01_normalize.R
  DE-02_test.R
  DE-03_process-significant.R
  ```

<br>

## Slow down and document

#### Use README files to document

Use README files to document the following:

- Your methods
- Where/when/how each data and metadata file originated
- Versions of software, databases, reference genomes
- *...Everything needed to rerun whole project*

::: callout-note
#### See this week's Buffalo chapter (Ch. 2) for further details.

#### For documentation, use plain text files

Plain text files offer several benefits over proprietary & binary formats
(like `.docx` and `.xlsx`)^[These considerations apply not just to files for documentation, but also to data files, etc!]:

- Can be accessed on any computer, including over remote connections
- Are future-proof
- Allow to be version-controlled

**Markdown** files are plain-text and strike a nice balance between ease of writing and reading,
and added functionality --- we'll talk about those next.
