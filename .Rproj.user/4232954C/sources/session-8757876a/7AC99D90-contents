## VS Code

### Why VS Code?

VS Code is basically a **fancy text editor**.
Its full name is Visual Studio Code, and it's also called "Code Server" at OSC.

To emphasize the additional functionality relative to basic text editors like Notepad and TextEdit,
editors like VS Code are also referred to as "**IDEs**": *Integrated Development Environments*.
The RStudio program is another good example of an IDE.
Just like RStudio is an IDE for R, VS Code will be our IDE for shell code. 

Some advantages of VS Code:

- Works with all operating systems, is free, and open source.
- Has an integrated terminal.
- Very popular nowadays &ndash; lots of development going on including by users (*extensions*).
- Available at OSC OnDemand (and also allows you to SSH-tunnel-in with your local installation).

### Starting VS Code at OSC

- Log in to OSC's OnDemand portal at <https://ondemand.osc.edu>.

- In the blue top bar, select `Interactive Apps` and near the bottom, click `Code Server`.

- Interactive Apps like VS Code and RStudio **run on compute nodes** (not login nodes).
  Because compute nodes always need to be "reserved",
  we have to fill out a form and specify the following details:
  - The OSC "_Project_" that we want to bill for the compute node usage: `PAS2700`.
  - The "_Number of hours_" we want to make a reservation for: `2`
  - The "_Working Directory_" for the program:  your personal folder in `/fs/ess/PAS2700/users` (e.g. `/fs/ess/PAS2700/users/jelmer`)
  - The "_Codeserver Version_": `4.8` (most recent)

- Click `Launch`.

- First, your job will be "*Queued*" — that is, waiting for the job scheduler to allocate compute node resources to it:

![](img/ondemand_vscode_queued.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

- Your job is typically granted resources within a few seconds (the card will then say "*Starting*"),
  and should be ready for usage ("*Running*") in another couple of seconds:

![](img/ondemand_vscode_running.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

- Once it appears, click on the blue **Connect to VS Code** button to open VS Code in a new browser tab.

- When VS Code opens, you may get these two pop-ups (and possibly some others) ---
  click "Yes" (and check the box) and "Don't Show Again", respectively:

::: columns
::: {.column width="52%"}
![](img/vscode-trust2.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
![](img/vscode-git.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

- You'll also get a Welcome/Get Started page --- you don't have to go through
  steps that may be suggested there.

### The VS Code User Interface

![](img/vscode-welcome_ed.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

#### Side bars

The **Activity Bar** (narrow side bar) on the far left has:

- A {{< fa bars >}} ("hamburger menu"), which has menu items like `File` that you often find in a top bar.

- A {{< fa cog >}} (cog wheel icon) in the bottom, through which you can mainly access *settings*.

- Icons to toggle **(wide/Primary) Side Bar** options:
  - ***Explorer***: File browser & outline for the active file.
  - ***Search***: To search recursively across all files in the active folder.
  - ***Source Control***: To work with Git (*next week*).
  - Debugger
  - ***Extensions***: To install extensions (*up soon*).

::: callout-note
#### Toggle (hide/show) the side bars
If you want to save some screen space while coding along in class,
you may want to occasionally hide the side bars:

- In {{< fa bars >}} > `View` > `Appearance` you can toggle both the `Activity Bar`
  and the `Primary Side Bar`.
- Or use keyboard shortcuts:
  - <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> for the primary/wide side bar
  - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> for the activity/narrow side bar

#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Try a few color themes

1.  Access the "Color Themes" option by clicking <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> =\> `Color Theme`.
2.  Try out a few themes and see pick one you like!

#### Terminal (with a Unix shell)

{{< fa user-edit >}} **Open a terminal** by clicking   {{< fa bars >}}   =\> `Terminal` =\> `New Terminal`.

**Create a directory** for this week, e.g.:

```sh
# You should be in your personal dir in /fs/ess/PAS2700
pwd
```
```bash-out
/fs/ess/PAS2700/users/jelmer
```

```bash
mkdir week02
```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### Editor pane and `Welcome` document

The main part of the VS Code is the **editor pane**.
Here, we can open files like scripts and other types of text files, and images.
(Whenever you open VS Code, an editor tab with a `Welcome` document is automatically opened.
This provides some help and some shortcuts like to recently opened files and folders.)

{{< fa user-edit >}} Let's create and save a new file:

1. **Open a new file:** Click the hamburger menu <i class="fa fa-bars"></i>, then `File` > `New File`.
2. **Save the file** (<kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>),
   inside the dir you just created, as a Markdown file, e.g. `markdown-intro.md`.
   (Markdown files have the extension `.md`.)

### A folder as a starting point

Conveniently, VS Code takes a specific directory as a **starting point in all parts of the program**:

-   In the file explorer in the side bar
-   In the terminal
-   When saving files in the editor pane.

This is why your terminal was "already" located in `/fs/ess/PAS2700/users/$USER`.

#### _If you need to switch folders, click   {{< fa bars >}}   >   `File`   >   `Open Folder`._

## Taking off where you were

When you reopen a folder you've had open before,
VS Code will resume where you were before in that it will:

- Re-open any files you had open in the editor pane
- Re-open a terminal if you had one active

This is quite convenient, especially when you start working on multiple projects
and frequently switch between those.

#### Some tips and tricks

-   **Resizing panes**\
    You can resize panes (terminal, editor, side bar) by hovering your cursor over the borders and then dragging.

-   **The Command Palette**\
    To access all the menu options that are available in VS Code,
    the so-called "Command Palette" can be handy,
    especially if you know what you are looking for.
    To access the Command Palette, click   <i class="fa fa-cog"></i>   and then
    `Command Palette` (or press <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>).
    To use it, start typing something to look for an option.
    
-   **Keyboard shortcuts**\
    For a single-page PDF overview of keyboard shortcuts for your operating system:
    {{< fa bars >}}   =\>   `Help`   =\>   `Keyboard Shortcut Reference`.
    (Or for direct links to these PDFs:
    [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) /
    [Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) /
    [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf).)
    A couple of useful keyboard shortcuts are highlighted below.

#### Specific useful keyboard shortcuts *(Click to expand)*

Working with keyboard shortcuts for common operations can be a lot faster than using your mouse.
Below are some useful ones for VS Code (for Mac, in some case, you'll have to replace <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>⌘</kbd>):

-   *Open a terminal*: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> (backtick) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
-   *Toggle between the terminal and the editor pane*: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>.
-   *Line actions*:
    -   <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> / <kbd>C</kbd> will **cut/copy the entire line** where the cursor is, when nothing is selected (!)
    -   <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> will **delete a line**
    -   <kbd>Alt/Option</kbd>+<kbd>⬆</kbd>/<kbd>⬇</kbd> will **move lines** up or down.

Click the gear icon <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> and then `Extensions`,
and search for and then install:

- **shellcheck** (by *simonwong*) --- this will check our shell scripts later on!
- **Rainbow CSV** (by *mechatroner*) --- make CSV/TSV files easier to view with column-based colors
